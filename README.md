 tw-policies is a small library for Reinforcement Learning, with a focus in the policy gradient class of algorithms. It supports the REINFORCE algorithm and several Actor-Critic algorithms. You can find the networks and inference code for the policies and state-value evaluation code in the two main modules 'policy' and 'value' under 'models'. You can find premade algorithm implementations in the 'agents' module.
