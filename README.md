 tw-policies is a small library for Reinforcement Learning, with a focus in the policy gradient class of algorithms. The first stepping stone was the implementation of the REINFORCE algorithm, and now supports several Actor-Critic Methods. You can find the networks and inference code for the policies and state-value evaluation code in the two main modules 'policy' and 'value' under 'models'. You can find premade algorithm implementations in the 'agents' module.

Todo list:
 - SAC
 - Support offline training
 - Multi-Headed network outputs?
 - PPO/TRPO algorithm
 - Goal-conditioned training?
 - Shared weights feature extraction for Actor-Critic
 - automated tuning?
